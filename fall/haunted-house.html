            <h1>Haunted Houses: The Great and the Not-So-Great</h1>
            <p>Not all haunted houses are created equal. The best combine coherent storytelling, detailed sets, smart pacing, and engaged performers. Others rely on dark hallways, air horns, and long lines. Here’s a concise guide with examples.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Atmosphere first: immersive sets, lighting, and sound that tell a story before the first scare.</li>
                    <li>Varied scares: misdirection, timing, verticality, and interactive moments—not just jump scares.</li>
                    <li>Operational polish: pulsed entry, good spacing, clear egress, and consistent reset timing.</li>
                    <li>Cast engagement: performers who read group energy and avoid repeating the same beat.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="not-great">When haunted houses fall short</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Black-wall mazes: long stretches of dark plywood/tarp corridors with little set dressing or narrative.</li>
                    <li>“Conga line” pacing: groups stack up so you see scares reset, killing surprise.</li>
                    <li>One-note design: strobe-only rooms, air cannons, or loud horns without variation or misdirection.</li>
                    <li>Unclear operations: inconsistent pulsing, poor audio levels, or rooms that bottleneck and break timing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Concrete scenarios (what this looks like)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scenario A: 50-minute wait for a 6-minute walk-through with three actor encounters and repeated props; no story tie-in.</li>
                    <li>Scenario B: Groups released every 10 seconds; scares trigger for the front group and are spent for the next two.</li>
                    <li>Scenario C: A strobe maze with no visual anchors or pacing control; guests bunch up and staff can’t reset scenes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="tips">How to pick a good one</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for pulsed or timed-entry operations and mentions of “set design,” “story,” or “actors” in reviews (not just “it was loud”).</li>
                    <li>Choose off-peak nights to avoid conga lines and preserve timing.</li>
                    <li>Favor attractions with multiple themed areas; variety keeps energy up and reduces bottlenecks.</li>
                    <li>Scan photos for environmental detail (lighting layers, texture, sightline control) rather than empty black corridors.</li>
                </ul>
