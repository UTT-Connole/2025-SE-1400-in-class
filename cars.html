        <h2>All About Cars</h2>
        <p>
            Cars have been an integral part of modern society for over a century. The invention of the automobile revolutionized transportation, making it faster, more convenient, and accessible to the masses. Early cars were powered by steam, electricity, and gasoline, but the internal combustion engine quickly became the dominant technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the decades, cars have evolved in design, safety, and efficiency. Manufacturers have introduced countless innovations, from seat belts and airbags to advanced driver-assistance systems. Today, cars come in many forms, including sedans, SUVs, trucks, coupes, convertibles, hatchbacks, and electric vehicles.
